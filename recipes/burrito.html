<h3>Description</h3>
<p>dish in Mexican[2] and Tex-Mex cuisine[3] that took form in California cuisine, 
    consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various 
    ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it 
    more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their 
    tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served "wet", i.e., 
    covered in a savory and spicy sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.</p>
